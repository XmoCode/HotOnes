      "Surprisingly you do not get a whole lot of hot pepper smell from this but rather a sweet garlic aroma. Incredibly inviting smell given its loaded with so many peppers.",
    taste_review:
      "Sweet, garlic and fruity flavors are incorporated and then of course, all those peppers. Volcanic Pepper does a superb job creating this SUPER HOT sauce while delivering top notch flavor!",
    heat_review:
      "One of the very hottest non-extract sauces on the market today. At least when compared to the many I have either purchased or sampled.",
    label_review:
      "Art work is very cool. Norse mythology, Thor's Hammer! Love the company logo as well with the hot pepper incorporated in it and the volcano blowing its top! It all ties to volcano's on one of Jupiter's moons, I-O. ",
    looks_review:
      "I love the look of this sauce. A nice bold red with speckles of spices throughout. It's got a nice thick consistency but still pours well even after being refrigerated.",
    overall_review:
      "This sauce is a must for the serious chili-head. I keep a bottle in my fridge and when I run low, order more to keep the supply live! It is a bit on the pricey side but its well worth every penny!",

      "More vinegar than i would expect in the nose, but the bite does come through for the chiles.",
    taste_review:
      "Moderate acidity that adds great and immediate kick to a dish without overpowering it, so long as the dish can handle the acidity bounce. Use on tacos as a substitute for lemon or lime squeeze to get brightness along with the heat.",
    heat_review:
      "A moderate burn, that will get the sinuses loose (but not cleared out). Fades rather quickly.",
    label_review:
      "It adequetly describes the ingredients, has an expiration date, a refrigerate afyer opening admonition,  and has a few clever little taglines. Nice colors, but seems a little busy .",
    looks_review:
      "Bright reddish/orange. And smooth. No chunky bits in there. Good enough to be dabbed directly onto the plate for decoration.",
    overall_review:
      "This is a very versatile, flavor-enhancing choice. I would put this as a topping in mexican food or american burgers, on the plate for fish dishes, and perhaps in a cocktail like a bloody mary to enhance the warmth.  Could be a grwat upgrade to a basic hot wing sauce if mounted with a little butter. Any assertive dish that would not be put off by too much vinegar presence",

      "A peppery sweetness.  Notes of garlic and vinegar.  The simple ingredients results in a clean taste, allowing the taste of the chili to shine through.  ",
    heat_review:
      "I'm not going to lie, it's intense.  The burn starts quickly mid palate and lingering in the back of the throat. A long, lingering heat finish.  ",
    label_review:
      "The Tropical Pepper Co.'s normal mascot is a toucan holding some peppers in its beak.  However, this toucan is skeletonized in a nod to the name of the chili and the heat of the sauce.  ",
    looks_review:
      "It looks vibrant and fresh.  A bright reddish color with a smooth uniform texture throughout.  Thin but with a definite viscosity.  Notably missing the oily sheen that many hotter sauces have.  ",
    overall_review:
      "Once you start getting into the 6 figure scoville range, most hot sauces use pepper extracts.  I don't like those types of sauces.  They tend to have an oily texture, an unpleasant astringent smell and a harsh taste.  None of that is present here.  Since they use actual ghost chili's, its more natural and gives you more of the chili's character and flavor.  While it isn't the hottest thing out there, it is plenty hot. At 500,000 scovilles, it's gonna be plenty for most chili heads.  A great sauce.  ",

      "there is serious heat here.  the peppers are ripe and fruity (just like the aroma told us) the sodium is sublime and just adds to flavor.  garlic is an after note that simply builds a flavor profile",

      "serious burn here.  no flow  restrictor and you can easily over pour.  if you try it alone you will be a 45 second numbing on the tip of your tongue",

    overall_review:
      "maybe too hot for most people.  although garlic does build a stronger flavor profile. this sauce is kinda of a one hit wonder.  it is not hot even for experienced chili heads. but the pepper flavor is largely absent.  i use it for heat intensity.  beware the easy pour",

      "Hot hot hot!! A penny size drop of this stuff will send you running to the frig for a gallon of milk. The heat builds gradually till about five minutes if you try enough of it. Not a very taste and sends your throat burning too. If you are looking for something hotttt then this will give you it.",
    heat_review:
      "Pretty hot if you aren't used to really spicy hot sauces and the ghost chili can really be felt. Takes about 20 minutes for the heat to wear of depending on how much you try.",

      "This sauce has a very smoky taste that I think would do excellent in certain applications like bbq or chili. I've used about a half a bottle so far to spice up my lunch chicken and wouldn't recommend it for this application. I'm giving it a 3 because, although the taste is very good for what it is, it's not a well rounded sauce. ",
    heat_review:
      "This is a hot sauce that has a sharpness to it. And it is hot. Not Oh I eat Taco Bell diablo sauce all the time so this will be cake walk  hot, but big league hot. Use caution at first to properly determine how much to use. Contrary to other reviewers, I don't think it lingers long though. ",

I also imagine a bit would be fantastic mixed in my favorite BBQ sauce. I personally don't think it shines as a spread or for general use, and would advice only using it when you want a smokey flavor.",
